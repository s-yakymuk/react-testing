## Start application locally

To start a local back end API execute the following commands in your terminal:

```
npm run server
```

API will be available at http://localhost:3000/, you can change the dataset by editing `./src/server/db.json` file.

To start client application (available at http://localhost:3000/) please execute:

```
npm run dev
```

**Both client and server apps should be running to use application locally!**

## Testing (default mode)

```
npm run test
```

Runs all of the available tests, showing results in the terminal. Runs in watch mode by default, waiting for the code changes to re-run the tests.

## Testing (UI mode)

npm run test:ui
```

Starts a local web server at http://localhost:51204/**vitest**/#/ with a user-friendly UI that allows manual interaction with the test suite

## Testing (coverage)
